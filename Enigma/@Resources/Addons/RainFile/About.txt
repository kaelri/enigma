RAINFILE
v 0.9.4
by Kaelri

-----------------------
ABOUT

This is an addon for the Windows system monitoring application, Rainmeter (http://rainmeter.net). It sends a !WriteKeyValue command to Rainmeter, using a file or folder chosen by the user as the key's new value. 


-----------------------
INSTRUCTIONS

The calling command must specify the dialog type ("File" or "Folder"), section name, key name, target file, and default or current value, as such:

"C:\Program Files\Rainmeter\Addons\RainFile\RainFile.exe" "File" "SectionName" "KeyName" "FileName" "CurrentValue"

Called from a Rainmeter skin, the command would look something like this:

!Execute ["#@#Addons\RainFile\RainFile.exe" "File" "Variables" "FileLocation" "#SKINSPATH#Config\Variables.inc" "#CURRENTPATH#Image.jpg"]

The addon must be placed in Rainmeter's addons directory (default: C:\Program Files\Rainmeter\Addons\RainFile\RainFile.exe).
